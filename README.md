## Conflict Plan
As a team we will maintain the relations between us as much as possible, but you know there may be some conflicts in some stages, so we will first inform the Team-Leader about those conflicts, he will try to solve them. If this conflict can’t be solved or it can be described as a high level conflict, then we will inform the TA’s about this, and they will try to solve it. But as a team we will be supportive of each other and if there is any way to help each other and make the workflow as smooth as possible as we can.

## Communication Plan
As a team, we discussed the time that we want to work in, and this will be the as following :
- In the class time, we will attend the breakout room and try in this time to work as we can.
- After the class time, we will have a break so that we can refresh ourselves and come back again with an energized soul that wants to make progress. We picked a two hours break then we will go back to work again.
- Friday will be an off-day for us, so that we can take some rest before we go back to work again.
- We will ensure that everyone will share in this project and every voice will be heard, an as a Team-Leader I will ensure that everyone will take his piece of this work, and I will ensure to break the ice between the team members so that it turn from technical and work environment to a fun and enjoyable time.

## Work Plan
As a team we all agreed on the project idea, so that we all have the passion to do this project and we define the basic shape for our project, define the features and the head point of this project. We broke the ice between the team members and talked freely about the weakness and strength points in the coding. So, we assigned the tasks fearfully and everyone was satisfied with his taks and his piece of the work.
We will use the management tools that are available outside as GitHub projects and trello, we also define our progress plan and define some milestones that work as indicators that we are making progress in this project .

## Git Process
As a Git platform, we will use it as much as we can, it is a good friend for us, to monitor the versions of our files in the projects, make remote collaboration something really good and effective.
For this manner, we will do the following procedure:
- Every team member will work on his task, after we finish we will do the PR one by one, and the Team-Leader will do the merge after he ensures there are no conflicts in the files.
- Next day every team member will do the pull request in the morning for the main branch and do their tasks and so on.
- This collaborative work will be done by making an organization in GitHub that has all the team members, in this organization we will have the project repository and on this repository we will do the above procedure.
